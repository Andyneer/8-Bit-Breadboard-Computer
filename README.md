# 8-Bit-Breadboard-Computer
This project follows Ben Eater's series on building a breadboard computer using the SAP-1 (Simple-As-Possible-1) computer architecture outlined in Paul Malvino's book: "Digital Computer Electronics".
It was built using 7400-series transistorâ€“transistor logic chips and a few EEPROMs to store microcode and decode input for the 7-segment displays.
Modules were built and tested individually before combining them all with the bus and control logic.
