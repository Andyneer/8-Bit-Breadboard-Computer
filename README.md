# 8-Bit-Breadboard-Computer
This project follows Ben Eater's series on building a programmable breadboard computer using the SAP-1 (Simple-As-Possible-1) computer architecture outlined in Paul Malvino's book: "Digital Computer Electronics".
It was built using 7400-series transistorâ€“transistor logic chips, 555 timers, and a few EEPROMs.
Modules were built and tested individually before combining them all with the bus and control logic.
The computer has only 16 Bytes of RAM so programs are quite limited but it is Turing complete.

The programming language for the computer is a custom assembly language with 11 Instructions:
| **Instruction** | **Code** | **Description**                                                                                                         |
| :-------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NOP             | `0000`   |  Do nothing.                                                                                                            |
| LDA(address)    | `0001`   |  Load the contents of the given address into the A register.                                                            |
| ADD(address)    | `0010`   |  Add the contents of the given address to the contents of the A register.                                               |
| SUB(address)    | `0011`   |  Subtract the contents of the given address from the contents of the A register.                                        |
| STA(address)    | `0100`   |  Store the contents of the A register in the given address.                                                             |
| LDI(value)      | `0101`   |  Load the given value directly into the A register.                                                                     |
| JMP(address)    | `0110`   |  Jumps to the given address.                                                                                            |
| JC(address)     | `0111`   |  Jumps to the given address if the carry flag is set.                                                                   |
| JZ(address)     | `1000`   |  Jumps to the given address if the zero flag is set.                                                                    |
| OUT             | `1110`   |  Output the contents of the A register to the 7-segment display.                                                        |
| HLT             | `1111`   |  Halts the computer.                                                                                                    |

Additional information for how each instruction works is available in the [Programming-Language.md](Programming-Language.md) file.

## Clock Module

After struggling with inconsistencies with the bistable mode for the clock module, the below modification to the bistable circuit solved the issues and allowed the use of a button instead of a switch for stopping and starting the clock.
